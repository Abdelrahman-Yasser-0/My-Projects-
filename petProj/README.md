# Pet Adoption System (Paws)

This is a Java-based Pet Adoption System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, designed to allow users to manage shelters, pets, and adopters. The system supports functionalities like pet management, adopter profiles, pet adoption requests, and notifications.

## Project Features
- **Pet Management**: Shelters can add, update, or remove pets available for adoption.
- **Adoption Requests**: Adopters can request pets, and shelters can accept or reject requests.
- **Admin Management**: Admins can manage the shelter details and oversee the adoption process.
- **User Authentication**: Separate accounts for admins and adopters with login and signup functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The main programming language.
- **JavaFX**: For the user interface.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The system is designed with OOP principles.
- **File Handling**: Data is saved and loaded using text files in the `src` folder.
