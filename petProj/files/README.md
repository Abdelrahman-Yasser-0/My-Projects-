# Project Files

This folder contains various data files used by the Pet Adoption System.

### Files Included:
- **Shelter Data**: Stores the shelter details.
- **Admin and Adopter Data**: Stores information about admins and adopters.

### Notes:
- All the files in this folder are included in the `src` directory of the project, so there is no need to copy them again. They will automatically be loaded and saved by the application.
